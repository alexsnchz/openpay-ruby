# openpay


##Description

ruby client for Openpay API services (version 1.0.0)

This is a client implementing the payment services for Openpay at openpay.mx

For more information about Opepay vist: http://openpay.mx/
For the full Openpay API documentation take a look at: http://docs.openpay.mx/

## Installation

   Add the following line to your Gem file

   # gem install --source https://code.stripe.com stripe

    gem 'openpay'

Update your bundle:

    $ bundle

Or install it from the command line:

    $ gem install openpay

##Requirements

    * ruby 1.8.7 or higher

## Usage


### Initialization
```ruby
require 'openpay'

#include Openpay module
include Openpay


#merchant and private key
merchant_id='mywvupjjs9xdnryxtplq'
private_key='sk_92b25d3baec149e6b428d81abfe37006'


#An openpay resource factory instance is created out of the OpenpayApi
#it  points to the development environment  by default.
openpay=OpenpayApi.new(merchant_id,private_key)

#To enable production mode you should pass a third argument as true.
#openpay_prod=OpenPayApi.new(merchant_id,private_key,true)
 ```

The openpay factory instance is in charge to generate the required resources through a factory method (create).
Resource classes should be initialized using the factory method as described below.

 ```ruby
#creating an instance for each available resource
bankaccounts=openpay.create(:bankaccounts)
cards=openpay.create(:cards)
charges=openpay.create(:charges)
customers=openpay.create(:customers)
fees=openpay.create(:fees)
payouts=openpay.create(:payouts)
plans=openpay.create(:plans)
subscriptions=openpay.create(:subscriptions)
transfers=openpay.create(:transfers)
```

According to the current version of the Openpay API the available resources are:

*bankaccounts
*cards
*charges
*customers
*fees
*payouts
*plans
*subscriptions
*transfers

 Each rest resource exposed in the rest Openpay API is represented by a class in this ruby API, being OpenpayResource the base class.


### Implementation
 Each resources depending its structure and available methods will have one or more of the methods described under the methods subsection.


#### Arguments
Given most resources  belong either to a merchant or a customer, the api was designed taking this in consideration, so:

The first argument represent the json/hash object, while the second argument which is optional represents the customer_id.
So if the just one argument is provided the action will be performed at the merchant level,
but if the second argument is provided passing the customer_id, the action will be performed at the customer level.

 ```ruby
#Merchant
open_pay_resource.create(hash)

#Customer
open_pay_resource.create(hash,customer_id)
 ```


####  Methods Inputs/Outputs

This api supports both ruby hashes and json strings as inputs and outputs.
If a ruby hash is passed in as in input, a hash will be returned as the method output.
if a json string is passed in as an input, a json string will be returned as the method function output.

This excerpt from a specification demonstrates how you can use hashes and json strings

```ruby
 it 'creates a fee using a json message' do
      #create new customer
      customer_hash= FactoryGirl.build(:customer)
      customer=@customers.create(customer_hash)

      #create customer card   , using factory girl to build the hash for us
      card_hash=FactoryGirl.build(:valid_card)
      card=@cards.create(card_hash, customer['id'])

      #create charge
      charge_hash=FactoryGirl.build(:card_charge, source_id: card['id'], order_id: card['id'], amount: 4000)
      charge=@charges.create(charge_hash, customer['id'])

      #create customer fee , using json as input, we get json as ouput
      fee_json =%^{"customer_id":"#{customer['id']}","amount":"12.50","description":"Cobro de ComisiÃ³n"}^
      expect(@fees.create(fee_json)).to have_json_path('amount')

    end
```

Here you can see how the card hash representation looks like

```ruby
require 'pp'

pp card_hash
{:bank_name=>"visa",
:holder_name=>"Vicente Olmos",
:expiration_month=>"09",
:card_number=>"4111111111111111",
:expiration_year=>"14",
:bank_code=>"bmx",
:cvv2=>"111",
:address=>
{:postal_code=>"76190",
:state=>"QRO",
:line1=>"LINE1",
:line2=>"LINE2",
:line3=>"LINE3",
:country_code=>"MX",
:city=>"Queretaro"}}
```




####Methods

This ruby API standardize the method names across all different resources using the create,get,update and delete verbs.
For full method documentation take a look at:   http://docs.openpay.mx/

(The test suite at test/spec is a good source of reference)

#####create

   Creates the given resource
 ```ruby
     open_pay_resource.create(representation,customer_id=nil)
 ```


#####get

   Gets an instance of a  given resource

```ruby
open_pay_resource.get(object_id,customer_id=nil)
```


#####update

   Updates an instance of a given resource

```ruby
open_pay_resource.update(representation,customer_id=nil)
```



#####delete

  Deletes an instance of the given resource


```ruby
open_pay_resource.delete(object_id,customer_id=nil)
```



#####all
   Returns an array of all instances of a resource
```ruby
open_pay_resource.all(customer_id=nil)
```

#####each
   Returns a block for each instance resource
```ruby
open_pay_resource.each(customer_id=nil)
 ```



#####delete_all(available only under the development environment)

   Deletes all instances of the given resource

```ruby
#in case this method is executed under the production environment an OpenpayException will be raised.
open_pay_resource.delete_all(customer_id=nil)
```


## Exceptions/Errors

This API is built over the great rest-client gem.
So our exceptions are based on their exception classes.


    #En el caso de listar un objeto no existente una excepcion de tipo RestClient::ResourceNotFound sera lanzada

      expect { @cards.all('111111') } .to raise_exception   RestClient::ResourceNotFound

Al generarse una exepcion se genera tambien un warning, si tienes acceso a la consola, podras ver ahi tus mensajes de errror en forma de warnings
